# Run gitlab-env.sh to print variables required in GitLab CI.

# This GitLab CI pipeline triggers Google Cloud Build on changes:
# - Provisioning of infrastructure
# - Building of services
# - Deployment of services
#
# Triggering the builds is required because the GitLab repository is not available on the Internet
# so that we cannot add triggers to Google Cloud Build.
#
# The actual workflow steps should be implemented in scripts to avoid a strong dependency on Google Cloud Build.
